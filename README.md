# flask-vue-boilerplate
This repo is a boilerplate for any websites using vue that have a python back-end. This is a very simple demonstration of POST and GET http requests to add and remove books from a data structure in the backend.

# Run example client and server
// run the server 1st
cd server
flask run

// then run the vue website
cd ../client
npm run dev

open localhost:5173/ping on your browser
